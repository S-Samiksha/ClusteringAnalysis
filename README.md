Updates (K-means): <br>
1. Basic kmeans done
2. kmeans clustering has `init` variable --> random, kmeans++ --> need to be explore
3. Do we want to code kmeans by ourselves or focus on the sklearn and use that to explore?
4. what is the `score` in kmeans in sklearn? Like what formula do they use and what is it returning?
5. How sklearn does its distance calculation
6. Seems to predict well for water distance, cntr_dist for some reason but not price
